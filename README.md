## 1 HTML Basics
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started
#### NESTING ELEMENTS IS POSSIBLE (by putting <strong></strong> inside the tag in the word very)
<p> My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy. </p>

#### Block-level elements AND Inline elements
Block line elements form a visible block on the page. Appears on a new line before or after
Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements. Surround on small parts of the document contents
[ REFER TO CODE ]

#### Empty Elements
Some elements follow the open then close tags, but some only need one tag
such as <img> tag

#### Attributes
Elements can have attributes (extra information)
for example 
href="the website" is an example of an attribute
title = "this pops up when hovered over"
class = "css thing"
Anchor < a> will make a piece of text it wraps into a hyperlink.
